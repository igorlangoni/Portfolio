### Overview

The idea behind this project was to combine my interest in front-end development with the benefits of having a personal portfolio webpage to showcase my skills to friends, family and potential employers. I had done some front-end before, but this one was hands-down the most fun I ever had doing it. Plus, the fact that it has real-world applications makes it even more special.

##### Tool Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Features

As of right now, the website site contains 4 sections within the landing page:
  - About
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Contact

It's also fully adjustable for mobile and different screen sizes.

### Coming up Next

Hopefully, in the coming days/weeks, I will be able to extend each section and add more projects as I finish them.

### Challenges

Although this isn't a particularly complex page, my experience with front-end development was not massive, so it took me some time to be able to make everything look good and in place.
Speaking of having stuff in place, the media queries were particularly difficult, and I spent a good amount of time making sure the page was responsive and looked nice on all devices, big or small.

### What I would do differently

I took the inspiration for the design from the internet. Moving forward I want to be able to come up with my own designs.
